# Streamlit-app-ML-Light-vs-Dark-Mode-study

🚀 [Click here to try the live app](https://app-app-ml-light-vs-dark-mode-study-su6ppdsxdsj9bevzwwzgwv.streamlit.app/)

A Streamlit app and machine learning study exploring how light vs dark mode affects user performance on digital tasks.

This is an interactive web application built using **Streamlit** that integrates machine learning models and a data dashboard. The app allows users to explore data, retrain models, and visualize results all from a browser.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Interactive data dashboard
- 🤖 ML model retraining (e.g., logistic regression)
- 📁 Works with user-provided CSV data
- 🧠 Built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn
